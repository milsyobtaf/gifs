## Reactions!
My collection of reaction gifs. I have these mirrored in a folder on my local machine, and access them through Alfred using a modified version of this workflow, http://destroytoday.com/blog/gif-workflow/.

## [Them GIFs](https://github.com/milsyobtaf/gifs)

**Modifications**
* Set filetype to look for JPG / JPEG and PNG in addition to GIF
* File filter still looks inside the local mirror on my machine
* This Github repo is set as a GH Pages public site, with my custom domain name as a CNAME
  * I miss the automagic upload of Dropbox, but I just make it a point to `git commit && git push` once a week or so to keep my collection fresh to death
* I added Cloudflare DNS to the custom domain name to allow for free / easy SSL
